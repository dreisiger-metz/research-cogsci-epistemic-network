                       of the thesis
                "Extensions of DUAL and AMBR"

                       presented by
                 Alexander Alexandrov Petrov



   The thesis of Mr. Alexander Petrov is related to the ongoing work on
cognitive modeling at the Cognitive Science department of the New Bulgarian
University.  Mr. Petrov demonstrates deep knowledge of cognitive architectures
and models and presents a comprehensive and critical, though somewhat too
long, overview of the essence of the cognitive architecture DUAL and the
cognitive model AMBR based on this architecture.  The interdisciplinary
approach is a merit of this part of the thesis.

   The main goal and the particular task of the investigation are clearly
outlined.  The modifications of DUAL and AMBR introduced by the author and
the development of the computer implementation of the DUAL architecture for
the sake of the cognitive modeling of the process of reasoning can be regarded
as a successful fulfillment of the outlined tasks.  Detailed description of
the knowledge-representation scheme and the computational mechanisms used
by the model AMBR2 makes it understandable even for nonspecialists in the
field.  The design, the performance, and the results of the simulation
experiment are well described and pointing to the possibilities of AMBR2 as
a cognitive model which can be used in the future for further simulations
of the process of reasoning with the emphasis on analogy despite the
difficulties of the task of analogy-making.

   I think that the work of Mr. Petrov presents in a very satisfactory way
the present level of knowledge in the field, contains original ideas and
contributions, and meets the highest criteria for a Master of Sciences thesis.
