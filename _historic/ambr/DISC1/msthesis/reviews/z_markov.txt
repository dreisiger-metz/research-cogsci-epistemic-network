  of  "Extensions of DUAL and AMBR"  by Alexander Petrov,
    thesis submitted as a partial fulfillment of the
           requirements for a M.Sc. degree


1. Scope
~~~~~~~~~
The work falls into the area of cognitive modeling.  It describes an
extension of an existing cognitive architecture (DUAL) and a particular
model buit on top of it for the purposes of analogy-making.


2. Structure and content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The thesis is structured in 6 chapters.  Chapter 1 presents a short
overview of the scope of the work and its goals.  Though the goals are
specified following the advice of an AI authority (McDermott), it would
be better if they would have been derived from some open problems
discussed in the second chapter. (The McDermott's proposal addresses a
work plan for building a thesis rather than a way of describing its
goals.)

Chapter 2 serves as an introduction to the problem domain discussing some
well-known cognitive architectures and models of analogy-making.  The
description is mainly based on comparison between DUAL and other well-known
cognitive architectures.  It would be better if some more attention would
have been paid to the description of the domain of cognitive modeling
itself.  This would give the work more self-explanatory character and thus
broaden its potential audience.

Chapter 3 is a description of the DUAL architecture.  Clearly presenting
such a complex thing is by no means an easy task.  The author has succeeded
to present the general ideas and to clarify all the details about DUAL.  In
some places, however, there is too much detail which makes it difficult to
'see the forest behind the trees' (the author admits this too).

Chapter 4 presents the main contributions of the work -- AMBR2.  This is
intended to be an improved version of the previous model -- AMBR1.  I believe
that this is so.  However, this should have been made clear by some
experimental work.  Though the experiments shown in Chapter 5 prove the
plausibility of AMBR2 as a cognitive model, a comparison with the results
of AMBR1 (or other cognitive models) for the same domain would be more
convincing.


3. General evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The description of the material shows that the author masters well the area
of cognitive modeling.  Furthermore it shows his additional knowledge in
many related fields as Neural Networks, Knowledge Representation, and other
AI classics.  The result presented in the thesis shows a real advance in
the area of modeling the complex phenomenon of analogy-making.  Furthermore,
the computer implementation developed by the author can be used not only to
continue the line of research started with the present project but also as
an experimental framework for other related projects.

The mentioned above drawbacks are normal for such an ambitious project
undertaken by a research student.  They do not undermine by any means the
overall contributions of the author.

Following these arguments I can certify that the submitted thesis fully
complies with the requirements of the M.Sc. degree.
