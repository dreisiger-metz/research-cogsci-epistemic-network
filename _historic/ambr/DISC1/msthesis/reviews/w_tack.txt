
       Review of a Master's Thesis by A. A. Petrov on

              "Extensions of DUAL and AMBR"


Goals
~~~~~~
On page 6 of the thesis, Petrov presents five goals for his thesis
project which are -- in a different order --
   -- refining the conceptual structure of DUAL,
   -- developing further the AMBR1 model,
   -- running simulations,
   -- creating a program which implements the new version of DUAL,
   -- writing a program implementing the new AMBR2.

I will review his thesis by asking how well these goals are reached.


Refinement of DUAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since I do not know the details of that version of the DUAL architecture
from which Petrov started, I am unable to evaluate how far his refinement
progresses from this starting point and how large the scope of refinements
really is.  What I can evaluate is the result, and that is a conceptually
clear and highly differentiated presentation of a cognitive architecture
with lots of features which can probably be shown to be very useful for
different cognitive modeling tasks.

The only negative point I want to mention here is that Petrov does not
always give reasons for design decisions underlying his version of DUAL.
Let me use as an example the 'teapot structure' introduced as an example
in figure 3.3.1.  The agent representing knowledge about an individual
teapot can point directly (by using the 'inst-of' slot) to the corresponding
concept-agent. In order to reach the agent representing the teapot's
specific colour, it must go via another agent which is an instance of the
'color-of' concept-agent. There may be good reasons for such different
access strategies, but Petrov does not tell us about them.

This is an example only. I have similar problems with using activation
integrals over time as values of variables having energy properties. Another
example is that there are no reported reasons for not distinguishing between
some kinds of declarative and procedural knowledge representations. The
simple statement that the reasons given by others who favour such a
distinction are not convincing is not enough.  This can be seen in connection
with the fact that Petrov presents no typology of attached procedures in
DUAL according to how they are triggered (if-needed, if-added, watchdogs,
etc.).


AMBR
~~~~~
The development of AMBR2 is based on an impressively broad knowledge of all
existing theoretical approaches to retrieval and mapping processes in
analogical thinking.  Petrov presents an excellent analysis of what has been
developed and proposed in this field.  Starting with the results of his
analysis, he gradually builds up AMBR2.  On this way, he takes into account
lots of empirical results and shows how the already known phenomena can be
explained by features he builds into his system.  The result is AMBR2 as a
very differentiated and powerful system which fully takes into account all
aspects of the current discussions and developments in research on analogical
thinking as well as all known phenomena concerning retrieval and mapping in
analogical thinking. This development is simply excellent.


Simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
AMBR2 obviously has been implemented.  Petrov uses a small number of analogy
tasks to collect simulation data which show that the system really does what
it is supposed to do and that it is able to model human analogy-using behavior.
It is shown that the whole conceptual machinery Petrov has built is really
useful for explaining empirical phenomena in its domain.


Implementation of DUAL and AMBR2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is the only really dark spot in the thesis.  In fact, it is really a
deep hole.  Despite the fact that Petrov himself has named the development
of the two computer implementations 'goals' of his thesis project, the
thesis itself does not contain any information about the programs.  I am
sure they exist; otherwise Petrov could not have generated the data he
reports.  But the reader of the thesis gets no information about the
structure of the programs, about the methods used to implement concurrent
processes, about the techniques used to prevent the system from running
into deadlocks, not even about the language used (LISP with or without CLOS,
maybe a special language for concurrent programming like OZ, or what?).


Style
~~~~~~
If there is a later revision of the text, Petrov should avoid positive
self-evaluations.  His program is indeed very ambitious, but he should not
say that himself several times.  Many aspects he takes into account are
indeed very important, but he should not ......

The first part of the text is highly redundant.  I did not count how often
Petrov tells his reader that a DUAL agent does not know who is the sender
of the messages it receives.  I suspect that several parts of the thesis
have been written at different times, and that these parts have been put
together on a computer later on without any control of unnecessary
repetitions.


SUMMATIVE EVALUATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Petrov has done much more and achieved much more than what is normally
expected in a thesis project.  The main results -- especially AMBR2 -- are
excellent.  Unfortunately, the thesis is not free from a few dark spots
which prevent me from porposing the best possible grade.
