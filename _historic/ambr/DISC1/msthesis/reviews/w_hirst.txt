   This thesis's chief interest is in building a model of analogical
reasoning.  The problem of how people construct analogies has received
much attention in the last few years, and a number of models have been
developed.  The present work uses Kokinov's DUAL general-purpose cognitive
architecture and extends this to a specific model of analogical reasoning,
AMBR, which is based on DUAL.  DUAL is a hybrid of symbolic and connectionist
architecture and has one important feature that figures centrally in the
present thesis -- it was developed specifically to handle the context-specific
nature of many cognitive phenomena.   Information in AMBR2 is represented
as concept or objects/events/situations and the links between informational
nodes are constantly open to revision.  AMBR2 differs from AMBR in several
ways, in particular, the introduction of a new activation function and
'secretaries'.  These innovations allow for a solid simulation of experimental
data and a good explanation of empirical findings.

   The thesis is clearly written and presents a major effort to advance our
understanding of analogical reasoning through the construction of cognitive
models.  It reviews previous efforts cogently and concisely and pushes the
framework developed by Kokinov in a deep and telling direction.  A fine work
capable of being published in a revised form.

   The thesis clearly represents work worthy of a Master's degree in Cognitive
Science.
