"People often perform several complex actions simultaneously (e.g. driving
a car and talking [...]). [...]
 Although I am not aware of any formal experimental study of the possibility
of several mappings running in parallel [...], there is some interesting
introspective evidence that makes such an assumption plausible (Hadamard,
1945) [...]"
                                                      [Kokinov 1994, p. 262]

   Spelke, Hirst, and Neisser (1976) studied the effect of practice on the
capacity of two subjects to read stories and write words to dictation
simultaneously. After 20 weeks of practice the subjects could not only
comprehend the story while copying but could even write down the semantic
category to which the word belonged. In another study, Hirst et al. (1980)
had their subjects read aloud while copying short sentences, and were still
able to do the task when the reading was switched from stories to much
denser and more demanding encyclopaedia passages. Hirst et al. suggest on
the basis of this finding that subjects are not performing the task by
switching attention rapidly between reading and writing, but it is not clear
that this is ruled out; although the encyclopaedia articles may be less
redundant than the stories, even difficult prose does involve a good deal of
predictability, which could allow an attention-switching strategy to operate.

   While these may sound like dramatic demonstrations, most of us can perform
complex tasks such as driving and speaking simultaneously with little apparent
interference, although one does tend to stop talking when a difficult traffic
situation develops. This phenomenon was studied in rather more detail by
Brown, Tichner, and Simmonds (1969) in a study that was concerned with the
possible averse effects of telephoning while driving. Subjects were required
to hear and verify sentences from the syntactic reasoning test [...] Subjects
were required to drive around a course on an airfield that was laid out to
have a number of "gates" between two sticks. Some of the gates were wide
enough, but some were too narrow to negotiate without hitting the sticks.
As Table 6.1. shows, the concurrent reasoning task appeared to have no effect
on the subjects' capacity to steer between gaps that were large enough, but
did impair judgement as to whether to accept the gap or not.
