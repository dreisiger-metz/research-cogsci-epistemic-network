OVERVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The experiment tests the behavior of the AMBR model on ten target problems.
(The representations of the target problems are kept in the KB/EPISODIC/
 folder of the diskette labeled DUAL&AMBR_1. Look for names beginning
 with 'T_'. See also file FILELIST.TXT in the same folder.)
The goal is to check whether the model can reliably access episodes from
long-term memory and map them to the target.

Each target problem is run 100 times, yielding a total of 1000 runs for the
ten problems.  See the archive GENKB.ARJ for the LSP sources generating the
100 KB variants that serve as a source of replications for the experiment.
See section 6.2.1. of the Thesis cited above for more details.


LIST OF THE FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file MAINEXP.LSP is the LISP program that runs the experiment.
  It loads KB variants and target problems in order, runs the AMBR simulation,
  and writes values to ASCII data files.  Note that the pathnames used in
  this program are represented as explicit strings. Modify them to match
  the directory structure on your installation.
  (The file MAINEXP.LSP is normally placed in the AMBR/EXPERMT folder.)

The subfolder RAW_DATA contains the raw data files as generated by MAINEXP.LSP.
  There is one data file for each KB variant.  See the documentation section
  of MAINEXP.LSP for more details on the cases stored in the data file and for
  a description of the variables contained in each case.
  The 100 small data files were concatenated in a single big data file which
  is not included in this archive. The big data file was ported into STATISTICA
  (ver. 5.0) for statistical processing. The data file in STATISTICA format is
  not included here either (it is over 2 MB long when uncompressed). The
  file TIME200.STA is an excerpt of the big file containing the values at
  TIME=200, i.e. at the end of each run.  It is included in the archive.

The file TIME200.RES contains the main results extracted from TIME200.STA.
These data are reported as Table 6.2.7 in the Thesis.  The file also lists
the names of the 32 variables from TIME200.STA.

Finally, the ten files HIST_???.STG keep the ten histograms printed in
sections 6.2.2 to 6.2.6 in the Thesis cited above.
The plots are in STATISTICA for Windows (ver. 5.0) format.
