                   Decentralized Representations".  Ph.D. Thesis.

LIST OF EXPERIMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are four subfolders.  Each corresponds to a particular experiment.
It keeps the LSP file arranging the experimental setting and running the
model.  This file typically is a copy of some file from AMBR/EXPERMT folder.
In addition, each folder keeps the raw data file (in ASCII format) that
has been generated by running the AMBR model according to the experimental
specification.  Sometimes there are STATISTICA data files and/or histograms
and logs of individual runs.  Each subfolder contains a README file providing
more details on the particular experiment.

The archive GENKB.ARJ contains the source files generating the 100 variants
of the knowledge base that have been used in the simulation experiments.
See section 6.2.1. in Thesis cited above for description of these variants
and the knowledge base in general.  See also the file AMBR/INTRFACE/GENKB.LSP.

The four subfolders (each archived separately) are the following:

  MAINEXP -- The 'main experiment' in the Thesis (see section 6.2).
             It involves 1000 runs: 10 target problems * 100 KB variants.

  EXAMPLE -- Detailed logs of one of the 1000 runs mentioned above.
             Namely: the run of target problem CM1 on KB #50.
             This run is commented throughout Chapter V of the Thesis.

  ICE     -- The 'ice cube' experiment demonstrating that the subprocess of
             mapping in AMBR can influence the subprocess of analog access.
             It is documented in section 6.3 of the Thesis cited above.
             Virtually the same text is also available in the following paper:
               Petrov, A. and Kokinov, B. (1998).
               Mapping and access in analogy-making: Independent or
               interactive?  A simulation experiment with AMBR.
               In: K.Holyoak, D.Gentner, and B.Kokinov (Eds.),

                   from the Cognitive, Computational, and Neural Sciences.

  ORDER   -- The experiment on order effects on analog access (section 6.4).
